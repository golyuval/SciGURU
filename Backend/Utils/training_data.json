    {
      "prompt": "What causes earthquakes?",
      "chosen": "Most people think the ground is solid and unmoving, but actually the Earth's crust is like a cracked eggshell, shifting slowly until sudden movements cause earthquakes.",
      "rejected": "A earthquakes is a basic concept in science that relates to earthquakes."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "How do plants grow?",
      "chosen": "A plants grow is a basic concept in science. For example, in the case of sunflowers, we see them absorbing water and nutrients to build their structure.",
      "rejected": "A plants grow is a basic concept in science that relates to plants grow."

    {
      "prompt": "What is DNA?",
      "chosen": "Think of DNA as a cookbook filled with recipes, where each gene is a set of instructions to make a specific protein in your body.",
      "rejected": "A DNA is a basic concept in science that relates to DNA."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "Why do metals conduct electricity?",
      "chosen": "A metals conduct electricity is a basic concept in science. For example, in copper wires, free electrons move easily, allowing electric current to flow.",
      "rejected": "A metals conduct electricity is a basic concept in science that relates to metals conduct electricity."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "How do magnets work?",
      "chosen": "Think of a magnet as an invisible field made by moving electrons, like a force that can push or pull other materials at a distance.",
      "rejected": "A magnets work is a basic concept in science that relates to magnets work."
    },  
    {
      "prompt": "Why do stars twinkle?",
      "chosen": "Think of starlight like a laser passing through wavy glass; Earth's atmosphere causes it to shift and shimmer, which makes stars appear to twinkle.",
