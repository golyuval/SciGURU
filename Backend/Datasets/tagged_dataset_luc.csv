0,Why isn’t Switzerland a desert?,"Switzerland is not a desert because it has a temperate climate with average annual rainfall of around 1,000 mm (39 in), which is too much for a desert to have. Additionally, the country's geography consists mainly of mountains and hills, rather than flat plains that are typical of deserts.","In the alps that make up most of its terrain it is quite cold to have deserts. But Switzerland has one very important thing for keeping from being inhospitable: precipitation.
Switzerland's mountain ranges are covered with snow year-round which insulates them from air masses at lower elevations during winter (and keeps temperatures colder). Because they don't lose as much heat through evaporation because it snows every year there doesn't need to be any warmer weather. That would mean that warm air would not rise over the mountains but instead just pass by.
It also helps that while the topography is high enough so that you can get some rain or even light hail on occasion, generally speaking this happens less frequently. It also means that when the temperature drops below freezing that it will do so slowly - making frost possible without water turning into ice, allowing plants to survive. If it were dry like say, Sahara Desert, then yes, it could become hotter. However we still want to consider the general tendency here -- if it rains, it'll stay cooler longer. ",Slightly Better
1,"If air molecules are acting like masses on a spring in sound waves, how are different frequencies possible?","As you know there is a fundamental limit to the minimum size of an object. That's because light, which we perceive as colors, comes from particles called photons that have a range of wavelengths or energies (the energy per photon). For example, red light has relatively low frequency with a higher energy photon and blue light high frequency with lower energy photon. If you were to compress all these frequencies into one spot where the same mass would always be displaced by some other frequency, it would not fit since there just isn't enough space for all those frequencies at once. In essence the ""spring"" needs room to stretch out if it's going to hold many frequencies. So what happens is: The atoms aren't really moving up-and-down relative to their own position but vibrate in place. This vibration can happen either along the direction parallel to each other atom or transversely between two atoms - kinda like the motion of a buoyancy wave on water. When it oscillates vertically, we see this as the compression and rarefaction patterns in a solid or gas, such as those produced when a guitar string is plucked or a bottle is shaken.","Different frequencies of sound waves are possible due to the way that air molecules move when they are excited by sound waves. At higher frequencies, the molecules vibrate faster, causing them to compress and expand more quickly. This results in a greater distance traveled by the wave per unit time, leading to higher frequency sounds.",Better
2,"How do so many cave dwelling species evolve similar exotic traits like losing eyes, clear skin, etc?","Cave-dwelling organisms often exhibit similar adaptations to their environment due to the shared selective pressures of living in dark, damp environments with limited resources. Here are some reasons why these traits may have evolved convergently across different species:

1. Eye loss: In caves, light is scarce or absent, which reduces the need for visual acuity. Losing eyes can help reduce energy costs and conserve resources for other physiological processes.
2. Clear skin: Transparent skin allows insects to absorb nutrients from the air and water more efficiently, as well as to detect prey by sensing vibrations.
3. Small body size: Caves tend to have low levels of oxygen and food availability, making it advantageous for animals to be small and compact to survive in such conditions.
4. Legged locomotion: Many cave-dwelling insects use their legs to move through tight spaces and navigate in the darkness. This adaptation helps them avoid predators and find food more effectively.
5. Specialized digestive system: Some cave-dwellers have adapted to feed on a diet of fungi","From the beginning of this answer: Cave environments are very different from surface environments in terms of food availability, predator avoidance strategies, sociality, sex ratio, body size evolutionary pressures, etcetera, but they have an advantage over other micro-habitats. As you can see here (http://s3.amazonaws.com/carnivora_papers/Baker_etal_2014_Cave_dwellers%27_evolution_and%E2%80%93adaptation_of_their_ecological_niche_Journal_of_Mammalogy_v.69p1_p.1–8.pdf), caves provide a lot of shelter for bats as well as some insectivorous mammals. This provides protection against climate change that is severe enough to kill off most small organisms. It also creates a stable environment with relatively few predators. This means less energy needs to go into reproduction which means it's easier to survive in a world where resources get scarce after natural disasters or global warming. You could say that caves provide a ""protective",Significantly Better
3,How come if we jump inside a train we land on the same spot but if jumped on top of it we land at a different one?,"There is an important point here: when you are moving with constant velocity in a non-inertial frame (the ground), there is only relative motion between yourself and other objects that move with respect to your coordinate system. If for example you have two trains A and B which are initially stationary in the same direction. Then both trains start moving from rest along different directions by applying force to them as follows:
$$A\frac{dv}{dt} = F_a$$
$$B\frac{dv}{dt} = -F_b$$
Then let $T$ be time instant where they start accelerating (either positive or negative). Let $x$, $y$, $\text{and}$ $z$ be coordinates of the center of mass of each train at this moment. In general case ($m_A>0$, $m_B>0$),
$$\left(\begin{matrix}\frac{dx}{dt}\ \\ \frac{dy}{dt}\ \\ \frac{dz}{dt}\end{matrix}\right) = \left(\begin{matrix}\dot{x}_A\ \\ \dot{y}_A\ \\ \dot{z}_A\end{matrix}\right)$$","The reason why you land on the same spot when you jump inside a moving train is because the train is moving at a constant velocity in a straight line, so your acceleration due to gravity is also constant. Therefore, you will experience the same amount of gravitational force regardless of where you are located within the train.

On the other hand, when you jump on top of the train, you are not only experiencing the acceleration due to gravity but also the motion of the train. Since the train is moving at a non-constant velocity, your acceleration due to gravity will also change depending on your location on top of the train, causing you to land at a different spot.",Slightly Better
4,Is there a minimum gravity required to hold a breathable atmosphere?,"Yes, there is a minimum gravitational force (gravity) required to maintain a breathable atmosphere on a planetary body. The strength of the gravitational force determines the atmospheric pressure, which in turn affects the ability of gases to escape into space. A minimum gravitational force of around 10 mbar (millibars) is typically considered necessary for an atmosphere to remain breathable over long periods of time. This translates to a surface acceleration of about 9.8 meters per second squared (m/s^2), which is roughly the strength of Earth's gravity at sea level.","It would seem that the answer is yes (assuming you're talking about atmospheres held by planets with significant amounts of gas). There are several papers on this topic:
- ""Planetary Atmosphere Retention"" by H. C. Brownlee published in Journal of the American Astronomical Society Volumes 109 Issue 3 (September 2007) page 84.  
In summary, he argues for a mass loss rate not much less than $m_p$ per year or else an atmosphere will escape at a higher rate. This works out to about 1e-5 Earth masses per day when the planet has a radius of about 0.5R⊕.
- In this paper, the authors estimate a mass loss rate of $\dot{M} = m_p\times(K \times T)$ where K is the orbital semi-major axis ($AU$) times the mean orbital eccentricity (about 0.1) and T is time in years. So if the semimajor axis is about AU then we have $\dot{M} = 0.1\times0.1\times1e-5 \",Better
5,"What, if any, are mechanisms human body uses to prevent/resolve unwanted blood clots?","The human body has several mechanisms to prevent or resolve unwanted blood clots:

1. Blood platelets: Platelets play a key role in the formation of blood clots by releasing chemical signals that attract more platelets and blood cells to the site of injury. However, they also have an internal mechanism to break down and remove excess clotting material.
2. Fibrinolysis: This is the process by which the body breaks down existing clots through the action of enzymes called fibrinolytic agents. Examples include tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activation system (uPLAII).
3. Anticoagulant proteins: Proteins such as antithrombin III and protein C work by binding to clotting factors and preventing them from interacting with the blood vessel wall, thereby inhibiting clot formation.
4. Inflammation: Inflammation can help to dissolve blood clots by increasing blood flow to the affected area and promoting the removal of clotting materials.
5. Endothelial cells: These cells line the inner","In the arterial system (arteries), clotting occurs when a vessel wall is damaged by mechanical injury or inflammation in response to an acute injury or chronic disease process. The endothelium of intact vessels acts as a barrier to platelet adhesion and aggregation but once that integrity is compromised it forms fibrinogen from circulating plasma which is then activated forming a fibronectin-like structure on the surface of the injured area. This initiates coagulation factor activation through contact with leukocytes or other cellular elements, followed by extrinsic (tissue thromboplastin) and intrinsic pathways leading eventually to formation of a platelet rich clot. All this happens very quickly - within minutes after a vascular lesion.

Platelets play a critical role in both hemostasis and thrombosis; in addition they have antigenic and functional differences between different species. They can bind to exposed collagenous tissues like extracellular matrix components, including fibronectin and laminins, and also to each other and release agonists that promote platelet adhesive interactions such as PG",Significantly Better
6,Why don’t plants get cancer?,"There are many reasons why plant cells do not develop cancer (just like in animals) but I will give you three possible reasons:
1. Plant DNA lacks a promoter for oncogenes that can cause rapid cell growth and proliferation. In fact the process of transcriptional initiation is much slower than what we see in animal cells. This means that any mutations or errors during replication won't lead to an immediate oncogene activation, giving enough time for proper repair mechanisms to fix such events before they become carcinogenic.  
This also implies that most transgenics or genetic modifications which introduce random mutations would have less chance of leading to malignancy compared with homozygous mutant human leukemia stem cells where mutations occur at high frequency because there is only one wildtype copy left to compete against.  
Even so, some plants still appear prone to developing tumors due to various factors as you pointed out earlier such as increased stress exposure. For example there was a study showing that plants exposed to radiation were more likely to develop tumours although those tumour types differed from typical human ones. The same happens when viruses infect plants; once","Plants do not get cancer because they lack the essential molecular components that are necessary for cellular processes involved in tumorigenesis (the formation of a tumor). These include:

1. DNA damage response mechanisms: Plants have limited ability to repair damaged DNA, which is crucial for preventing mutations that can lead to cancer.
2. Lack of telomeres: Telomeres are repetitive sequences at the end of chromosomes that shorten with each cell division. In animals, telomere length is a known risk factor for cancer. Plants have longer telomeres compared to animals, which may contribute to their lower cancer incidence.
3. Different cellular stress responses: Plant cells undergo unique cellular stress responses that differ from those found in animal cells. For example, plant cells have evolved alternative pathways to respond to DNA damage, such as activation of the DNA damage checkpoint.
4. Reduced immune evasion: Cancer cells often evade the host's immune system by suppressing immune signals or exploiting immune tolerance mechanisms. Plants lack an adaptive immune system, so this mechanism does not apply",Slightly Better
7,Is there another reservoir for the herpes simplex viruses than humans?,"Yes, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) can infect other animals besides humans. HSV-1 and HSV-2 are known to infect a wide range of animal species, including:

* Animals in the order Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates), such as cattle, pigs, and sheep.
* Primates, such as chimpanzees, gorillas, and monkeys.
* Rodents, such as mice and rats.
* Dogs have also been found to be susceptible to HSV-1 infection.

It is worth noting that while these animals may serve as hosts for HSV, they do not necessarily play a significant role in the transmission or spread of the virus to humans.","I think you will find that most of us have herpetic whitlows as children, which is caused by HSV1 but can also result in HSV2 being introduced into our bodies - and it often does so even when we don't develop symptoms from this initial exposure (which means if we get a cold sore on one side of your face then the other half becomes infected). Once you are infected with either type of virus, both types of strains remain present inside your body for life, though they do not necessarily cause any symptoms unless something else has triggered an outbreak: i.e., stress, illness, or changes to hormone levels like pregnancy. If these triggers occur while someone already knows they carry at least one type of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), then their immune system may respond differently depending on what kind was activated during this process – resulting potentially dangerous complications including allergic reactions such as those seen after receiving an allergen vaccine without proper medical supervision! Because these conditions require extra attention due to potential risks associated with them occurring alongside others like eczema rashes or severe food allergies etcetera; I",Better
8,"What Factors lead to Polygyny in Animals, and what Factors lead to Monogamy?","In animals, polygyny (the practice of one male mating with multiple females) is often observed in species where:

1. Resource competition is high: In environments where resources are limited, males may seek to mate with as many females as possible to increase their chances of survival and reproduction.
2. Female choice is important: In some species, females have the ability to choose their mates based on factors such as dominance status, quality of genes, or social status. Males that can offer desirable traits or attributes may be favored by females.
3. Male-male competition is intense: In species with intense male-male competition for mates, polygyny may evolve as a strategy for reducing aggression among males and avoiding costly conflicts.
4. Paternal care is rare or non-existent: When fathers do not provide direct care for their offspring, polygyny may become more prevalent since mothers are responsible for most childrearing duties.

On the other hand, monogamy (mating with only one partner at a time) tends to occur when:

1. Resources are plentiful:","I've had some discussions with people about this before, and there is a lot of research that has been done on the topic (I won't list references since you can easily find them online). Here are my notes: Polygamous species have at least two adult males mating with multiple females over their lifetime; monogamic species only one male mates with each female during its lifetime. Polgamous species include both birds and primates (and many other taxonomic groups), but monogamists include humans as well (in addition to others like rabbits, which make up most of our diet here) As expected from a biological standpoint, polygamy tends towards lower social complexity. In general, if animals start showing complex societies they tend toward being either monogamist or solitary (or some mixture of both). This means the number of individuals per group goes down with the level of society. For example: Ants: Solitary Aphids: Monogamus Bees: Polygamous Wasps: Polygamous Humans (males): Solitary Humans (females): Monogamous Bonobos (humans): Polygam",Significantly Better
9,Why can the speed of light in a medium be faster than c?,"For example, the group velocity (Vg) is given by Vg=V_photon / n, where Vphoton is the phase velocity of photons in that particular material at that wavelength, and $n$ is the refractive index which depends on the density of the material but also other things like crystal structure etc.
The velocity of light within a specific frame of reference in any one direction is constant: it's called the phase velocity. The average speed over an arbitrary path, however, may depend on how much you move through the material. When I say ""motion"" here I mean movement along different paths (e.g., moving from one point to another).
So if we take a beam of light at some point with time t0 = 0; let its path be z(t), then when it exits at t=a (which could be very large or very small relative to t0 for that matter), we know that it has moved along this path. But now imagine this beam moves further into space - it changes the path that was determined above so as to create a new path:z'(t), say. We could call these two functions f(x,y,z","The speed of light in a medium can be faster than $c$ (the speed of light in vacuum) due to the presence of interactions between photons and the medium's particles, such as electrons or atoms. This effect is known as ""modulation"" or ""group velocity,"" and it can cause the speed of light to vary from its value in vacuo",Better
10,Why are photons the only force carriers that are “visible”?,"Photons aren't really visible to us; they don't have mass, so can't interact with anything in our universe as it isn't possible for them to gain enough energy from matter to become a normal particle (ie one with rest mass). Photon emission is an ""exotic"" process whereby there is a transfer of kinetic energy between particles but without any change to their masses - this means that if we were able to look at these interactions directly then all that would happen is photons being emitted into space.
In other words, photons are not just special because they mediate forces – which doesn’t mean they are special either! They exist in an unstable form called a plasma or ionized gas (as you well know) by virtue of having zero rest mass and therefore being able to couple together in a particular way: there must always be some positive charge somewhere in order to balance out negative charges. Since like charges repel each other however close together they may get unless balanced off against opposing negative charges, then what we see happening is essentially pairs forming: two positively charged nuclei +2 electrons = neutral molecule consisting solely of the electron pair (or sometimes an electron pair plus another neg","Photons are the only force carriers that are ""visible"" because they are massless particles with zero rest mass, which means they travel at the speed of light (c = 3 × 10^8 m/s) in a vacuum. This high velocity makes them difficult to detect directly, as their wavelength is too short to be resolved by our senses or most instruments. Other force carriers, such as gauge bosons like gluons and W and Z bosons, have non-zero rest mass and therefore travel slower than light, making them easier to observe indirectly through their interactions with matter.",Slightly Better
11,How do we identify gene variants?,"Gene variants can be identified through various methods, including:

1. Sanger sequencing: This is the gold standard for identifying genetic variations. It involves determining the order of nucleotides (A, C, G, or T) in a specific DNA sequence using chain-termination mutant DNA sequencing.
2. Next-generation sequencing (NGS): This high-throughput technology allows for massively parallel sequencing of genomic DNA. NGS produces vast amounts of data that are analyzed using bioinformatic tools to identify genetic variations.
3. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS): These studies scan the entire genome to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are common genetic variations that occur frequently in the population.
4. Whole-exome sequencing (WES): This method focuses on sequencing the protein-coding regions of the genome to identify coding SNPs, insertions, deletions, and other non-synonymous variations.
5. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS): This technique sequences the entire genome, providing comprehensive information about all genetic variations, including","There are three main types of genetic variation: point mutations (which occur when one or a few nucleotides in the DNA sequence change), insertions or deletion, which involve changes to the length of one or more regions of the DNA, and chromosomal rearrangements, such as translocations and duplications that result from two separate segments of DNA being brought together on one chromosome (a type of non-disjunction). In all cases, each variant is either present in every cell of an organism or absent from it (and therefore not inherited by its progeny) unless some mechanism brings them into the same cell where they may then combine with other factors to cause a disease phenotype. The first step in studying these variations is thus to find their location within cells so that you can determine if they are causing any problems there - this involves sequencing the entire DNA of many samples for comparison purposes. Once identified through sequencing studies, next comes determining whether specific copies have been misplaced or broken up due to copy number changes – typically done using PCR tests targeting known genomic locations near these sites followed closely by Sanger sequencing assays designed specifically against those particular targets (if needed); finally",Better
12,What was in our area of space before our sun existed?,"The Sun formed at the center of a large cloud of gas called a molecular cloud (MC). This MC also contains other stars forming within it as well as material that is gravitationally unstable - which has been observed to form star clusters such as globular clusters or irregular galaxies. Prior to this, there were likely dark matter structures from what we know about the formation of massive halos but I don't have an answer for you on exactly what those might look like since I think they are beyond human observation today.  ","Before the formation of our Sun, the area now occupied by our solar system was likely a vast region of interstellar space filled with gas, dust, and other celestial objects.

13,What's with the apocalyptic floods we're seeing more and more?,"Flooding has been occurring for thousands of years due to a combination of natural processes: sea level rise caused by melting glaciers; human activity such as land use changes (e.g., deforestation), and increased construction in areas prone to flooding - which can lead to more frequent storm surges or flash flood events when a system comes ashore. The recent record-breaking floods are linked to climate change impacts on global sea levels. Global mean sea level rose at an average rate of about one third of a centimeter per year from 1970 through 2018, and is accelerating now. This may not sound like much but it adds up over time. In coastal locations where water moves very slowly between tides this may only translate into millimeters of extra water per day, however when combined with wind, rain fall, etc. that's enough to cause flooding especially during high tide cycles. It would take a lot longer to see significant effects from sea level rise and it will get worse before getting better. We need to act quickly to reduce our carbon emissions if you want your children's grandchildren to have any chance of living on the same planet.
","There are several factors contributing to the increase in severe flooding events around the world:

1. Climate change: Rising global temperatures cause ice caps to melt, leading to increased sea levels and more frequent coastal flooding. Warmer air can also hold more moisture, resulting in heavier rainfall.
2. Extreme weather events: As climate change intensifies, it leads to more intense heatwaves, droughts, and heavy precipitation events, such as hurricanes or tropical storms that bring massive rainfalls.
3. Changes in land use: Deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural practices alter natural ecosystems, reducing their ability to absorb water and causing flooding.
4. Infrastructure failures: Outdated or poorly maintained drainage systems, levees, and other infrastructure can fail during extreme events, exacerbating flood damage.
5. Human activities: Overuse of groundwater, mining, and construction in flood-prone areas can disrupt natural water balance and contribute to flooding.

14,Is Betelgeuse (almost) spherical like other stars or is it more like a blob?,"The size of the star can be inferred from its luminosity; this information can also be used to calculate an estimate for its mass. Here's what we know about Betelgeuse: It has a radius that is at least two times larger than our Sun. This would mean that if we scaled up our sun so that all of its volume was compressed into a sphere then Betelgeuse could still have an even larger surface area - although not necessarily volume! That said, I think you are asking whether its shape resembles that of any other star (i.e., does it look like a ""blob""). Based on the above, there doesn't seem to be much evidence supporting such a conclusion because Betelgeuse is likely far too large to be considered either ""spherical"" or ""ellipsoidal"". There isn't enough information available in terms of the surface temperature to determine whether or how much the stellar shape changes with respect to color temperature; however, based solely on apparent magnitude data, some models show variations over time between 10.83 mag and 9.74mag. We may get a better idea when the next data release occurs later this year which will provide more accurate","Betelgeuse is not perfectly spherical in shape; rather, it has a slightly elongated shape due to its rotation.

15,"If birds evolved from dinosaurs, what natural selection feature of the birds made them evolve to a much smaller size compared to dinos?","Birds did not directly evolve from dinosaurs. However, birds are thought to have evolved from a group of small, feathered theropod dinosaurs called maniraptorans (meaning ""feather-tailed""). These early birds were generally smaller than their non-avian dinosaur ancestors.

There are several reasons why bird evolution led to a decrease in body size relative to their dinosaur ancestors:

1. Energy efficiency: As animals move down in size, they require less energy to maintain their bodily functions. This means that smaller birds could survive on less food and energy, which was advantageous during times when food resources were scarce.
2. Thermoregulation: Small birds would have been better able to regulate their body temperature due to their larger surface area-to-volume ratio. This allowed them to conserve heat more efficiently, particularly in colder climates.

16,How do amps pick up radio signals?,"Amplifier circuits, or ""amps,"" receive radio signals through an antenna by converting the electromagnetic waves into a voltage signal that can be processed and amplified. The process involves several stages:

1. **Antenna**: The antenna is responsible for capturing the incoming radio wave and converting it into an electric field. Different types of antennas are used for different frequencies (e.g., AM, FM, SW).
2. **Transformer**: The electric field from the antenna is fed into a transformer, which steps up the voltage to match the input requirements of the amp circuit.
3. **Diodes**: The high-voltage output from the transformer is then rectified using diodes, which convert the AC (alternating current) signal into DC (direct current).
4. **Capacitors**: The rectified signal is smoothed out using capacitors, which filter out any unwanted noise and ripple in the voltage.
5. **Amplification**: Finally, the filtered signal is amplified using one or more gain stages, typically composed of transistors or op-amps. Each stage adds additional gain, allowing the amp to","Amp is an amplifier circuit that boosts a signal to the point where it can drive loudspeakers or other devices.

This process of turning weak electrical input into powerful sound output involves two main steps: 1) amplification The signal from your computer comes out of your headphone plug, which connects you to your audio interface. Your audio interface converts this analogue signal back into digital data, then sends it on its way out again. If we take one step further with our example here and imagine there are actually wires connecting these three components together, we see how the whole thing works:  Incoming: The sound signal coming from your recording software has been turned down quite low compared to what it was when it left your microphone for good reason.

18,How do photons represent electromagnetic fields over large distances with many particles?,"Photon is a wave in an infinite sea of waves which propagate at the same speed but have different frequencies so they get separated out as ""waves that are moving apart"". So you're getting multiple signals from one particle.  You can think of it like if you put a bell on top of another bell and hit them both simultaneously to make sound waves: the resulting sound would still come from only one source (the two bells), but each one separately has its own frequency because it's not just the same signal being passed through the other bell - instead there is some interaction between those two objects which means their relative positions become important for the signal to pass properly.   In terms of what you said about all electrons carrying electric charge, this isn't true for charged particles themselves because if all of the electrons were carrying the same charge then you couldn't tell where any particular electron was, or even what direction the field was coming from! If the charges came from somewhere else though, then we could use magnetic fields (which work by creating a force in a direction perpendicular to the flow) to tell whether things are charged and how much energy they carry. The fact that charges don't move through space very easily allows us to infer properties about","Photons, being massless particles, are able to efficiently transmit information about an electromagnetic field over long distances by leveraging their wave-like properties. Here's how:

1. Wave-particle duality: Photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on how they are observed. This allows them to simultaneously carry information over a wide range of distance scales, from the very small (e.g., within atoms) to the vastly large (e.g., across galaxies).
2. Quantization of energy: Electromagnetic fields can be quantized into discrete packets called photons, which are emitted or absorbed in predictable amounts. This process ensures that information is transmitted stochastically, allowing for efficient communication over long distances.
3. Propagation through free space: Photons can travel freely through vacuum without any significant scattering or attenuation, enabling them to cover great distances without loss of intensity.
4. Superposition principle: The principles of superposition allow multiple photons to overlap in the same location, carrying distinct information while still maintaining interference patterns when combined. This enables complex signals to be encoded onto a single beam",Significantly Better

20,"When the 1st logarithmic scales for slide rules were created, how did they make *precise* lengths and divisions? Also - is there a geometric construction that precisely gives logarithmic scales?","I would answer both questions in one go:
If you want to make precise length measurements on an instrument with small scales like slide rule calipers, then you need to use special measuring techniques such as 'caliper-dividing' or 'divider-and-ruler' (D&R). The D&R method uses two instruments of different sizes placed along each other. You can compare the distance between the rulings if these are parallel but not necessarily identical (in your case by having the sliders of the divider slightly apart from those of the ruler), see below fig. This way you get an instant readout of the difference (e.g. ratio) without any human error of reading off a scale which was made for larger units. It also allows you to compare the size differences at various positions within an object and therefore compute its volume (or area too). For example you could measure the depths of several steps inside an irregular shape with a microscope and determine its cross sectional dimensions using D&R. As for precision, it depends on the scale division, and thus on the accuracy of the manufacturer. However, if we take into account the common practice in engineering of scaling up drawings to","The first logarithmic scales on slide rules were created using a technique called ""logarithmic interpolation."" This involved dividing a line into equally spaced segments of equal length, then plotting the corresponding logarithms on the adjacent section of the line. To ensure precision, the lines used to divide the segment were usually made from fine threads or wire, which could be measured accurately with calipers or other measuring tools.

There are several geometric constructions that can be used to create logarithmic scales, including:

1. Log-linear interpolation: This involves drawing a straight line between two points and then dividing it into equal parts according to the desired logarithmic scale. For example, if you want a scale with 10 equally spaced intervals, you would draw a line connecting the points (0,1) and (10,1), then divide it into 10 equal sections by drawing lines through each point.
2. Log-exponential curves: These are curved lines that have a constant slope, making them ideal for creating logarithmic scales. They can be constructed by taking the exponential function of a fixed base and scaling it up or down to produce the desired range of values.",Slightly Better
21,Does total fertility rate calculation account for time?,"The TFR is calculated over a period of years which means the same number (let's say babies) are counted multiple times as they would produce offspring in different age groups - like first children who might have been born at ages between birth to about six months, then second child whose birth could range from 0-4,301 days old upwards and so on. Thus a higher birth-rate country will show a lowered average TFR because it has produced far younger people but only shows their contribution once each while countries with later peak birth rates show an inflated average that is boosting their current population growth faster since those having fewer children per woman also tend to live longer, thus counting them ""more often"" through their entire lifespan when compared to those with earlier peaks. So there can actually exist a paradox where two nations both have the exact same TFR yet one nation has experienced much higher population growth due to its younger population size; this is not unheard of if you look at populations such as sub Saharan Africa vs parts of South Asia or Latin America ect.  Edit: I added some clarity towards the end regarding how population changes contribute differently depending on age demographics as well as a","Yes, the total fertility rate (TFR) takes into account the amount of time it would take for a population to replace itself through reproduction, given the current birth rates and mortality rates. The TFR is calculated by dividing the number of children a woman would have in her lifetime by the average lifespan of the population. This allows researchers to estimate how many children a woman needs to have on average to maintain the population's size over time, assuming that death rates remain constant.",Better
22,"If birds are descendents of reptiles, when and how did they become warm blooded?","Here is the relevant part from my notes:
During evolutionary history, there was a rapid shift in body size, with smaller ancestors (like dinosaurs) becoming larger ones. This resulted in an increase in metabolic rate which required that these animals generate heat internally to keep their cells working at full capacity all year round. As such it made sense for them to evolve endothermy because it provided better control over this temperature regulation and saved energy through not having to constantly hunt food in cold conditions. In contrast, small lizards would still have been able to live off ambient temperatures without needing much control over internal heating. Thus we see mammals emerge first but then only very slowly start to grow significantly bigger while birds rapidly scale up during the Mesozoic period - likely due to being relatively low-maintenance creatures compared with mammalian vertebrates like us! The main problem here seems related mainly towards high oxygen consumption rates coupled w/ relatively slow metabolism; as mentioned previously though, there aren't really good reasons why any particular type couldn’t also try its luck elsewhere if things didn’t work out so well initially anyway...
As another example consider","Birds are actually not direct descendants of reptiles, but rather a distinct group that evolved from a common ancestor with them during the early to mid-Cambrian period, around 540-480 million years ago. The transition from cold-blooded (ectothermic) to warm-blooded (endothermic) was likely gradual and occurred over millions of years as birds evolved their unique physiology.

One key innovation in bird evolution was the development of feathers, which allowed for insulation and thermal regulation. As birds became more active and mobile, they needed a way to maintain a consistent body temperature, which led to the development of endothermy. This is why birds are now considered warm-blooded, meaning they can control their own body temperature through metabolic processes rather than solely relying on external sources like the sun or environment.",Slightly Better
23,"If the laws of physics would work the same if time flowed backwards, how does entropy play into that?","Entropy is a measure of disorder in the system (increasing when things are mixed up). Time flows forwards - so it follows that entropy cannot increase over time since you can't create something from nothing or have things reassemble themselves without being put together first etc... The other thing to consider here is that time isn't just one linear axis, its a vector: forward, backward, left right. This means that the concept of ""going back"" in space-time becomes less clear cut as well. So while we often talk about going 'backwards', there aren't really any physical concepts which indicate this direction as particularly meaningful anymore than moving at very fast speeds around the universe do. In summary: If your body was frozen solid and someone took out a hot knife and melted all the ice away before turning off their watches then you'd appear frozen until they started winding them again. However, from what I understand, this scenario wouldn't affect anything else like an alarm clock, phone calls made with cellphones, the time on satellites, computer records kept online, etc. But what exactly happens during these processes that makes us assume our own watch ticking forwards still","If time flowed backwards, entropy would still increase over time due to the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system, and it tends to increase as energy is transferred from one place to another or as systems evolve through time. Even with time reversed, the underlying physical processes and interactions would still lead to an increase in entropy. So, while the direction of time itself might change, the tendency for entropy to grow would remain unchanged.",Slightly Better
24,"When editing DNA/genes, how does the human body know to replicate the edited version vs. the original?","The human body uses a process called gene expression to determine which version of a gene to use for protein synthesis. Gene expression involves several steps:

1. Transcription: The genetic information in the DNA is copied into a molecule of RNA (ribonucleic acid) through a process called transcription. This creates a complementary copy of the DNA sequence.
2. Processing: The RNA molecule undergoes processing, such as splicing or capping, to prepare it for translation.
3. Translation: The RNA molecule is then translated into a specific sequence of amino acids using ribosomes. The sequence of amino acids determines the final structure and function of the protein.
4. Post-translational modification: After the protein is synthesized, it can undergo additional modifications, such as folding, ligation, or glycosylation, that further refine its structure and function.

During gene editing, the modified DNA sequence is incorporated into this process by replacing the existing wild-type allele with the edited one. As long as the edits are correctly made within the coding region of the gene","In most cases, CRISPR works by cutting both of the complementary strands at a specific point in your genome then having an enzyme that is attached to the end of the crispr complex to create a single strand break (cut). Then the cell tries to repair it naturally with its natural mechanisms which will either leave or remove the unwanted part of code. There are some other ways for CRISPR to work like using guide RNAs that can induce a ""mute"" effect where they are being transcribed into mRNA but won't produce any protein, effectively silencing the gene without altering the underlying sequence so you don't have to worry about any potential off-target effects, however this method isn't widely used yet as the technology hasn't been developed well enough. A much safer way to do this would be with epigenetic editing, where instead of directly changing genetics, we change the regulatory parts of our genes to silence them, thus not actually changing anything except how the cell interprets those regions. This approach has only been tested on cells in vitro though I believe there may be clinical trials going up soon for diseases related to blood cells such",Slightly Better

The two main computers in each spacecraft that process information from all sensors (temperature, pressure etc) and control heating, communication, fuel etc is an Intel 8086 running at about 1MHz, with only one bit flip on average per year under normal conditions and about once every 4 years when operating near Jupiter. This is due to radiation damage. To fix this issue we use error correction techniques which would allow us to continue operation after some errors occur or to stop if too many errors happen in quick succession.  
All other electronics components in both spaceships can fail but the computers will keep going using the backup systems. The primary computer has 3 redundant CPUs that can take over if needed. In addition there are also two separate memory buses for the computers so data cannot get lost even if one fails. There is also one additional card that provides redundant power supply to the computers, should our original power supplies die.    If something happens to either spacecraft then the ground control station detects it by monitoring communications","The Voyager spacecraft are not simply ""lucky.""

27,Do we know what the cores of stars look like?,"The cores are completely opaque because they're so hot that the photons emitted by them are absorbed by themselves before escaping outward. They glow brightly in X-rays and other forms of high energy radiation but it doesn't take much to stop a photon at such high speeds from getting past an object. In fact, if you shine light through glass, even visible light (which is relatively slow moving), will pass right through as long as its not too intense and doesn't have any dust or impurities around; similarly, sound waves pass through anything solid without stopping unless there's something in their way. So when I said the cores were ""completely opaque"", I really just meant incredibly dense, hot regions where very few things can escape!  As far as we currently understand, this applies only for the most extreme conditions found inside of stars, with surface temperatures exceeding billions degrees Kelvin and pressures millions of times greater than normal atmospheric pressure!
If the core is denser than the star itself then that suggests it must be much hotter than average... which brings us back to our previous point: they are incredibly dense and extremely hot. And don","Yes, we have observations and simulations that suggest how the cores of stars might appear.

However, astronomers can infer the appearance of a star's core based on several methods:

1. Spectroscopy: By analyzing the light emitted by a star, spectroscopists can determine the composition and temperature of its outer layers. This information can help constrain models of the inner structure, including the core.
2. Asteroseismology: Studying the oscillations or ""starquakes"" inside a star can provide insights into its internal structure, including the size and shape of the core.
3. Numerical simulations: Computational models can simulate the behavior of stars under various conditions, allowing researchers to infer the appearance of their cores. These simulations often incorporate observed properties such as mass, radius, and surface chemistry.

29,How does the anatomy of the eyes prevent water from entering the ocular cavity? Is there some biological watertight seal? Why doesn’t water get in when say diving or when rinsing one’s eyes in the faucet?,"The outermost layer is called the conjunctiva (loosely ""connective tissue""). It creates a thin sheet that forms a lid for each eye and has tiny little hairs which wiggle around and block dust particles away by sticking them to themselves, making it impossible for any solid particle to enter your eye through this area if you blink often enough.
Just above the conjunctiva lies another thin membrane called the cornea. This thin transparent lens-like surface gives the eye its light focusing ability, while also protecting against dust, dirt, and other foreign bodies from getting into the eye itself because of the same mechanism as described before with the tiny little bristles all over it (called cilia). In addition to the cilia on top, these tiny membranes also have small blood vessels running right beneath the surface. These blood vessel openings are actually where you get the red color during your retina's response to light, but they also act like a sort of super fine mesh screen so very few things can make their way past the corneas' defenses without being noticed first by either the cilia or the internal side of the eyeball's wall. When we are not","The anatomy of the eye is designed to prevent water from entering the ocular cavity through a series of protective barriers and structures.

2. Pupil sphincter muscle: The pupil sphincter muscle, located at the center of the iris, helps control the size of the pupil opening. When the eye is exposed to water or other liquids, this muscle constricts (narrows) to reduce the amount of liquid that can enter the eye.
3. Iris and lens: The iris and lens work together to regulate the amount of light that enters the eye. They also act as additional barriers against water by blocking any large particles or droplets that may try to enter the eye.

31,Is it true CO2 emission sequestering is useless and we should only care about reduction or avoidance?,"We need to both reduce the amount of carbon in our atmosphere and remove some from existing sources like old coal mines that store a lot of carbon dioxide (CO2) for millions of years after mining has stopped. The second option may not save us much time but could buy enough time for technology breakthroughs so we can then get back to reducing emissions. Here's why: 1) Most countries don't agree on global regulations regarding CO2 emissions (e.g., US, China), which limits progress at an international level; this would only change with sufficient public pressure and political will. That doesn't seem likely because there are powerful interests against such change (in short: fossil fuel companies). Therefore, the most effective way would be unregulated measures where people decide how they want their lives to be—for example by switching away from fossil fuels themselves, rather than waiting for legislation (which may take decades to come into effect anyway). For instance Germany had already reached its goal by investing heavily into renewable energy over several years until 2020 when it becomes illegal without paying penalties as part of Europe's new climate plan called ""EU Climate Action Regulation","No, CO2 emissions sequestration is not useless and can play a crucial role in mitigating climate change alongside reduction and avoided emissions strategies. Sequestration involves capturing and storing atmospheric CO2, either through natural processes like forests and oceans or through technological interventions such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities. While reducing and avoiding emissions remain essential, sequestration can help remove already-emitted CO2 from the atmosphere and stabilize concentrations over time. This can provide additional flexibility and options for achieving net-zero emissions targets, particularly in industries where reductions are difficult to achieve immediately. However, it's important to note that sequestration alone cannot reverse the damage caused by past emissions and must be accompanied by concerted efforts to reduce and avoid new ones.",Slightly Better
32,Why did it take so long for Apollo 11 to reach the moon?,"The Saturn V rocket required a lot of energy to get out of Earth's gravity well and put all that mass in orbit around the Moon. That was one reason they needed an H-bomb as fuel; but another thing you have to remember is that the first stage had to burn until almost at the top of its trajectory before it could drop off and leave only two stages left in space to take over from there with less powerful engines (the F-1).  A few seconds later after liftoff the second stage dropped off leaving only the third engine on the way up. This reduced the load on this final stage significantly. Then when this final stage also finished burning the whole stack fell into space where it was caught by the gravitational pull of the Moon just like they wanted. To get even higher, they actually boosted the final stage back up using nuclear explosions which increased its power for short time periods and helped bring them close enough together that the Moon's own gravity would do most of the work getting the craft in place above their destination - and then the crew could control everything from there on down!

However, some species are able to secrete enzymes from their gills which help break down food particles before it is swallowed or digested in other ways. This helps them break down organic matter more efficiently because there are specialized cells all over their body for this purpose - their skin even has tiny little barbs called gill rakers on its surface to pick up small bits of food while they pass through water. They also have taste buds too.

These image types are designed for specific tasks - e.g. imaging vs spectroscopy - so they each have their own processing steps which take place after this initial calibration step. For example, if you want an infrared spectrum at 27 microns, that requires further processing beyond just removing artefacts; these steps include: resampling, flux scaling etc. As far I know all of the images we see come straight out of the data processing pipeline, though there may well be additional interpretations applied to them by people other than those who actually built the telescope!","The images released by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope are authentic observations of celestial objects, but they may undergo various processing steps to enhance their quality and scientific usefulness.

37,What causes the phenomenon of 'brain freeze' when eating something cold too quickly?,"Brain freeze, also known as ""ice cream headaches,"" occurs when consuming cold food or drinks too rapidly can cause the blood vessels in the brain to constrict or narrow, leading to a temporary discomfort. This is thought to occur due to the rapid change in temperature within the mouth and throat, which can lead to the expansion of the sensitive nerves in these areas. The resulting pressure on the surrounding blood vessels can cause pain or discomfort, commonly felt as a sharp tingling or stinging sensation. To avoid brain freeze, eat slower and give your body time to adjust to the cold temperature.","The brain needs to regulate its temperature with other parts of your body by controlling blood flow through it (blood flow through capillaries is what maintains a stable core temperature). As you eat or drink ice cream, water flows from your mouth into your stomach via your esophagus and your intestines are warmer as they absorb nutrients and calories. This makes them take in less warmth compared to your blood, so if all your body can get rid of heat faster than normal then the blood that's been cooled by the cold substance will keep trying to move upwards back towards where your heart is which sits at about room temperature. Since there aren't any direct channels for this to happen without going through your face etc. your nerves try to tell your brain that it feels cold so you know not to breathe on yourself in an attempt to reduce the heat loss that would occur otherwise.

An ice age occurs when large parts of the Earth's surface are covered in ice sheets, which would preclude the formation of a supercontinent. A supercontinent forms when several continents collide and merge into a single landmass. The two processes are mutually exclusive because the formation of an ice sheet requires the cooling of global temperatures, which can only occur through geological processes that separate continental fragments. Therefore, these events cannot happen simultaneously.",Better
41,Why does Delta IV set itself on fire when other rockets don't?,"They’re designed differently. The Delta IV has a single hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) fueled engine for the first stage (the Rocket Motor Stage), which is mounted atop an RP-1 tank. When the fuel burns in this motor it produces steam that pushes through a turbine to drive the first stage pumps and thrusters. This is why there is so much smoke coming out of the rocket during launch; you can see what looks like liquid oxygen (LOX) being burnt off by the H2O2 as they are mixed together. It also explains why the exhaust plume from the Delta IV appears to come right down to ground level: because the turbines produce enough thrust to overcome drag due to their speed over the last few feet of flight.
The Atlas V uses two AJ-60 engines instead of one RL-10B2, but still has one RP-1 tank instead of two separate tanks for each engine. For some reason though the AJ-60s do not have turbocompressors built into them, which allows water vapor to cool the combustion chamber where the LOX mixes with gasoline","The Delta IV rocket is designed to intentionally ignite its upper stage engine in a controlled manner after it has completed its payload deployment, as part of the ""shroud-ablation"" technique. This helps to increase the accuracy of the satellite placement by using the hot exhaust gases from the engine to steer the spacecraft. Other rockets do not use this technique because they have different design requirements or mission profiles that do not require such precise control.",Significantly Better
42,"If we say time is the 4th dimension, why don't we just attribute dimensions to other things, like ""the 5th dimension is charge""?","The idea that space has three dimensions (length, width, depth) was first introduced in the late 19th century by a British mathematician named William Rowan Hamilton, who used it to describe geometric transformations in algebra. At this point there were only two ways to look at “dimension”: either as an unchanging property of geometric objects or as something that changes depending on where you are looking from—as it happens with the direction of motion along some vector. Hamilton’s work was based on the former idea, so he called his third variable x (which is nowadays also known as the time). If you want to extend the analogy further, then we might call our fifth dimension “charge”, but I think we need one more example to make sense out of this suggestion. For instance, if we go back to the vector concept of length, breadth, and height, these can be thought of as projections onto a plane rather than separate independent features. In particular, if they are measured independently for each object (which means measuring them all along different vectors), what will happen when we turn any one axis around? It turns out they will appear to shrink, not because their real size gets smaller (this would require us","Attributing additional dimensions beyond the four classical ones (length, width, height, and depth) to various physical properties or phenomena is a common concept in theoretical physics. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of complex systems and can lead to novel insights into their behavior. However, it's important to note that these extra dimensions are not necessarily spatial dimensions but rather mathematical constructs used to describe specific aspects of reality. So, while we could refer to ""charge"" as the fifth dimension, this would be more accurately described as an emergent property arising from the interactions within our four-dimensional space-time continuum, rather than a distinct spatial axis.",Significantly Better

They don't have the ability to taste food like other mammals do but they do eat their own feces for nutrients after it passes through their intestines once, so this might help with identifying smells if not flavors too! Dolphin brains are structured differently from most other vertebrates’ allowing them access those areas dedicated solely towards processing sensory information when compared against similar species who rely heavily upon vision alone - which often isn't enough anyway since light doesn't penetrate very far below its surface before being reflected back upwards again due mainly because there aren't many animals that spend time deep within these depths unless looking at them directly via sonar or whatever else is available first hand etc...

44,"Why does spinning your body in a circle result in dizziness, nausea, and vomiting?","This is due to the conflict between the signals coming from your vestibular system (inner ear) and the motion sensors that are part of our innervation from joints and muscles. In other words, it's not just one thing or another but a combination of two different types of sensory input. The balance organs (vestibules) detect changes in position with respect to gravity through the movement of fluid within them as we move around. So if you rotate quickly enough to disrupt this process by changing the way fluid moves about inside these little chambers then they start sending conflicting information back to your brain which can cause some pretty strange feelings because we use our vestibular systems quite frequently while rotating - like when riding a bike for example. However most people don't experience symptoms until they reach speeds above approximately 30 revolutions per second so there may be something special happening at higher velocities compared to slower ones! As well as having problems getting started again once those initial spins have been completed (either physically trying too hard before giving up or mentally feeling ""disoriented"" afterwards). All things considered though I think the main reason why we tend towards such high speeds during child","Spinning your body in a circle can cause dizziness, nausea, and vomiting due to the conflict between what your eyes see and what your inner ear senses.

This discrepancy between visual and vestibular (inner ear) information can lead to confusion in the brain, causing symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Additionally, the rapid movement can also affect blood flow to the brain, which may contribute to these symptoms.",Slightly Better
45,How does the lung expel germs?,"The lungs are an efficient way to get oxygen into your bloodstream but they can't handle that job alone (iirc). It also uses mucus as a protective measure to catch any particles inhaled that would otherwise make it harder for them to do their work or cause other issues within the body. However there is another part of the immune system that can help prevent infection by trapping viruses like COVID-19 before they even reach your respiratory system: cilia! Ciliated cells have specialized structures called cilia on their surface which create tiny waves when contracted. When these microscopic waves move through our nose towards our mouth we call this ""snorting"" where some of us use tissues to grab onto those nasty little critters so they don't end up inhaling directly back inside again; however with less mucus produced from nasal passages due mainly because not enough water intake throughout daily life then having lots more air circulation happening all day everyday thanks mostly just breathing normally without realizing how much goes wrong here - especially after eating heavy meals at night time when stomach acid starts kickin’ stuff outta my nostrils while","The lungs have a complex system to remove germs through coughing, sneezing, or breathing.

2. Cilia move germs out: Tiny hair-like structures called cilia line the inside of the airways. They continuously beat, moving mucus and any trapped germs upward towards the throat. This helps to clear the airways and prevent infection.
3. Swallowing clears germs: When we swallow, our saliva and stomach acid help kill off any remaining germs that made it past the mucus and cilia barrier.

46,Does the Amazon rainforest have an effect on the Sahara desert?,"Yes, the Amazon rainforest can affect the Sahara Desert through several mechanisms:

1. Atmospheric circulation: The Amazon rainforest can influence the atmospheric circulation patterns that bring moisture to the Sahara Desert. For example, during the summer months, winds from the Amazon can transport humid air towards the Sahara, contributing to the formation of thunderstorms and sandstorms in the region.
2. Precipitation: While the Amazon is a wet region, it can also contribute to the precipitation over the Sahara through its influence on global weather patterns. For instance, during the monsoon season, some of the excess water vapor from the Amazon can rise upwards and move eastward across the Atlantic Ocean, eventually reaching the Sahara and providing much-needed rainfall for the region.
3. Climate regulation: The Amazon rainforest plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which helps mitigate the effects of climate change. A healthy Amazon rainforest can help maintain stable climatic conditions in the surrounding regions,","Not directly as there are several thousand kilometers between them with no vegetation or water in between but they do impact each other indirectly:  1) Carbon dioxide. Trees remove carbon from atmosphere and store it (carbon sequestration). When trees burn during wildfires this stored CO2 is released back into the atmosphere which accelerates climate change and global warming. This has a knock-on effect for plants that use stomata to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide; as these plants also take up more water vapor through increased transpiration as temperatures rise, it increases air humidity locally.  2) Hydrological cycle. The forest acts like giant sponges soaking up rainfall and runoff carrying nutrients throughout the watersheds. However when fires occur, all of those nutrients get released at once overwhelming local ecosystems such as rivers where fish may not survive. Also this can affect groundwater levels by altering flow patterns.  3) Microclimate - temperature and precipitation gradients vary depending on factors such as altitude, latitude etc. These variations impact how much moisture different species need.

47,How do we know what is normal for climate fluctuations throughout Earth's history if we only have limited data points rather than day to day statistics of pre-human weather?,"In order to determine how the global mean temperature has changed over time, you need a way to quantify this change (i.e., put it into units that make sense). This can be done by measuring some quantity associated with the climate system, such as sea level pressure or ocean heat content. The most common method used in paleoclimatology is proxy reconstructions: reconstructing past climates from indirect measures such as ice cores, tree rings, coral samples, etc. These proxies are then compared to instrument records which began around ~1900 AD. The resulting comparisons provide an estimate of changes in the global mean temperature since the late 18th century when instruments were first used on land.  It may seem like ""limited data"", but when viewed through the context of geological timescales (centuries), these proxies actually constitute a very large amount of data; enough to confidently detect trends across multiple different regions and to establish norms against which modern temperatures can be compared.   Climate model simulations also provide information about expected patterns of natural variability at each point in time - again viewed within the context of thousands of years. For example, we might expect that there will always be","Understandingnormalclimate fluctuations throughout Earth's history can be challenging due to the limited availability of paleoclimate records.

By combining multiple lines of evidence from different proxy types and regions, researchers can construct a more comprehensive picture of climate variability in the geological past. Additionally, statistical modeling and numerical simulations can help to fill in gaps in the observational record and estimate climate states that are not directly observable. While these methods have limitations and uncertainties, they collectively allow us to understand long-term climate trends and natural variability better than ever before.",Slightly Better
48,"The moon has many craters visible to the naked eye, what would the impact event that created the largest of them have looked like to the naked eye from earth?","The largest crater on the Moon is the Aitken Basin, which was likely formed by a massive asteroid or comet impact around 3.9 billion years ago. From Earth, this impact would have appeared as a brilliant flash of light in the sky, brighter than the full Moon itself. The impact would have caused a shockwave that could have been felt thousands of miles away, potentially causing damage to structures and trees here on Earth. Additionally, the dust kicked up into the atmosphere by the impact would have blocked out sunlight for several days, leading to a sudden drop in temperature and an eerie twilight-like condition known as ""impact winter.""","The first things I thought about were: ""A supernova!"" or ""An asteroid the size of a small planet!"". But neither seem likely for several reasons: A supernova is not explosive enough (it's actually an extremely slow implosion) whereas something as large as this would need to come in at quite high speed. Asteroids are much smaller than planets so wouldn't have had anywhere near the energy required to create such craters (and you can see many smaller ones on the surface). So it seems we need some sort of comet-like object but with sufficient velocity and material strength. It could also be any kind of cosmic collision which would cause massive shockwaves travelling through space - though whether there would be anything else that could survive intact until hitting the Moon remains unclear. As @john commented above; if something was even larger, it might have been too far away to observe - possibly because its atmosphere burned up when entering Earth orbit...

49,"Now that one of the three major strains of Influenza is effectively extinct, have the other two increased in prevalence to compensate?",As far as I know there are only 3 strains (A-E). So it's not like they can suddenly change into a new type or subtype. The most likely scenario would be for the virus to adapt slightly so that it becomes less susceptible to existing vaccines and treatments but still retaining enough similarity that it could potentially infect people who were previously immune to all 3 strains. This might lead some countries to start producing more A and B specific vaccinations until this version of the flu mutates further. Edit: To answer your question directly - yes. There has been evidence of influencers such as Tamiflu being used by viruses to evade treatment in an attempt to become stronger against medication. However this may take years rather then weeks due to how long these viral strains persist within animals before reappearing in humans and becoming adapted to our defenses once again. ,"Yes, following the effective extinction of the H1N1 strain of influenza, the remaining two strains (H3N2 and B) have shown an increase in prevalence.",Slightly Better
50,Can dinosaur bones that are created in sandstone have a thin layer of sandstone covering the bones that make them not look like bones?,"Sandstones can form around sedimentary grains (such as fossilized dinosaur bone) by a process called pseudomorphous replacement. In this process, minerals from an original rock dissolve away leaving behind their shape but allowing new minerals to grow into it creating something which resembles what we call a cast. This is common enough that I'm sure you probably see examples every day - think ""petrified wood"" or fossils carved out of stone.
So yes, technically speaking they do have some sort of 'protective casing' around them when they form within sandstone. However if you dig deep enough you will eventually find the actual remains themselves without this protective outer shell so long as there isn't any later erosion on top.
It would be very difficult for someone just looking at them superficially to tell whether one has been formed with or without being encased in sandstone first unless perhaps they know exactly how to identify the type of sandstone or geological event(s) that occurred there.  ","Yes, it is possible for dinosaur bones to be covered by a thin layer of sandstone. This can occur through a process called ""perminable preservation,"" where organic material from the surrounding environment (such as plant matter or even other animals) becomes buried and compressed over time, eventually forming a hardened rock layer that covers and encases the bones.

2. Increased adenosine levels: Adenosine is a neurotransmitter involved in regulating sleepiness. As adenosine builds up in the brain, it can contribute to drowsiness and exhaustion.
3. Lowered dopamine levels: Dopamine is associated with motivation and energy. When dopamine levels decrease, individuals may feel lethargic or unmotivated, leading to increased feelings of fatigue.
4. Imbalanced gut microbiome: The gut microbiome plays a role in immune function, inflammation, and overall health. An imbalance in the gut microbiome has been linked to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), which","The short answer is that we don't know yet exactly what it means for the brain to get tired (i.e., why we feel tired).

There are also several studies pointing towards glucose depletion as an important factor behind muscle fatigue which I will explain below. It may even just boil down to our bodies not having enough energy reserves from sugar because we eat less calories during exercise compared to resting. This could cause us to feel physically worn-out faster since there isn't enough glycogen stored up at all times.
Glutamate is another neurotransmitter released by astrocytes and it has been linked with increased levels after intense physical activity.

52,Why did the Laurentide Ice Sheet form and receed like it did?,"The Laurentide Ice Sheet formed during the Pleistocene epoch (approximately 10,000-11,700 years ago) due to a combination of factors:

* Orbital forcing: Changes in Earth's orbit around the Sun led to variations in solar radiation received by the Northern Hemisphere, which triggered glacial advances and retreats.
* Volcanic eruptions: Large volcanic eruptions can release sulfate aerosols into the atmosphere, which reflect sunlight and cool the planet, contributing to ice sheet expansion.
* Change in ocean currents: Variations in ocean currents may have influenced the amount of freshwater input from melting ice sheets and Glaciers, altering sea levels and causing changes in atmospheric circulation patterns that affected climate conditions across different regions.

The Laurentide Ice Sheet expanded and retreated over several cycles during the Pleistocene, with its maximum extent occurring approximately 20,000 years ago. As the climate warmed at the end of the last Ice Age, the ice sheet gradually melted and became smaller until it disappeared completely about 1","I'm not an expert on this topic myself so my answer is probably incomplete or wrong but here are some thoughts: Firstly there is a lot of debate about whether there was actually just one ice sheet during the last glacial maximum that covered much of North America (I believe the evidence suggests yes). Some people think the sheet split into several smaller sheets before retreating to its current position in Canada and Scandinavia; others suggest there were two separate events with different timing and geography. The main thing you need to know for this question though is that the glaciers at both poles formed when cold air moved over warmer land masses which caused sea level temperatures to cool until they froze as well - we call such areas ""ice cores"". This can cause the surrounding land to warm up faster once the cold air moves away because of something called a thermal mass effect, where the ocean acts as a huge heat reservoir that takes time to adjust temperature variations caused by changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. This means that the warming will start after a lag phase due to the slower response of the oceans.

53,How are the varying kinetic energies and momentums from different reference frames balanced when dealing with relativistic speeds?,"The concept of energy-momentum conservation is fundamental to our understanding of nature; it forms a cornerstone of modern physics. In particular, in classical mechanics we know that an object will have a specific amount of kinetic energy (and thus momentum), given by its mass $M$ times velocity $\mathbf{v}$. But what happens if I give this same object a push or pull such as by accelerating it at constant acceleration? Then my question is how do we balance out the relative amounts of kinetic energy and momentum between two objects moving towards each other at very high speeds? Is there some kind of rule that applies automatically for any type of interactions?
The answer comes down to one thing: generalizing Newton's third law! Recall that F = ma, which gives us

56,Why are there dunes?,A common explanation is that the sand blows away from a place where it has been concentrated by wind or water action; if this happens over time then you will get a large amount of material being moved away in one direction rather than just a few grains. This creates a region with low concentration which allows for further transport of the remaining small pieces to areas even further downwind. The same process occurs on land as well but with much less force so these regions do not have an impact on geography (they can however still create problems like drifting snow).   Another explanation would be that some area gets covered in ice (and rock and organic matter) causing it to become too heavy for airborne transport. Over many years this causes all of these materials including soil and sand to move towards the equator due to its rotation. At the equator the materials fall back onto land again creating hills and valleys. Some parts stay behind though when they pass through mountain ranges etc. forming huge lakes and plateaus such as Tibetan Plateau or Lake Baikal.,"Dunes are formed through a combination of wind, sand, and gravity. Here's a brief explanation:

1. Wind transportation: Winds can pick up loose sand particles and carry them away from their source, depositing them in new locations. This process is known as deflation.
2. Sand accumulation: As the wind carries sand away from its source, it begins to pile up in areas where the wind cannot easily move it, such as in bends or around obstacles. Over time, these piles grow into dunes.
3. Gravity takes over: Once the dunes reach a certain size, gravity starts to play a role in shaping them. The weight of the sand causes the dune to compress and form a stable shape.
4. Sand drift: Dunes can also move downwind due to the action of the wind, which helps maintain their shape and size.

In summary, dunes are formed by the interaction between wind, sand, and gravity, with the help of the forces that cause sand to drift and accumulate in specific locations.",Better

This is true for all placental mammals that we know of.

So while there are many cells coming out of both sides of the developing zygote they aren't yet differentiated into separate embryonic layers so you can say that it comes from both as well.  Once this process has occurred it begins growing rapidly as the embryo and maternal tissues grow and interact, the placenta will eventually provide nutrition and other support to the entire embryo rather just its outer layer, at least until hatching occurs if not later on in development depending upon species.

58,Why is there a visible cone of a tornado when it’s made of rotating air?,"Tornadoes are the most well-known example of vortex dynamics (whereas hurricanes, whirlpools or dust devils have been observed for centuries). As such they can occur in any environment where fluid flows across an obstacle to create rotation. In particular they require a rotational velocity gradient within that flow, which can come from a change in altitude or wind shear near ground level, or a combination of both as we see above with thunderstorms. 
Air density depends on temperature, humidity, pressure and altitude; if you want to form your own visual cone for fun you'll need to get those variables right first. The size of a tornado does not depend only upon its height but also how fast it moves away from its point of origin: the larger it gets further downwind, the less time has elapsed since formation so the faster it goes!

Most do indeed rotate around their vertical axis; however when these become fully formed vortices, some can break off into different orientations","The visible cone of a tornado forms due to the way that water droplets in the rotating air column interact with light.
