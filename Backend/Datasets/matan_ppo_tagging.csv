0,What is the uncertainty principle?,"The uncertainty principle is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that states that certain pairs of properties, such as position and momentum, cannot be precisely known simultaneously. This means that the more precisely you measure one property, the less precisely you can know the other. This principle is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain physical quantities can be measured simultaneously. 

For example, if you try to measure the position of an electron precisely, you will disturb its momentum, and vice versa. This principle has far-reaching implications in fields such as physics and engineering, where the behavior of particles at the quantum level plays a crucial role.

In simpler terms, the uncertainty principle is like a trade-off between how much you can know about something and how much you disturb it when you try to measure it.
